# Flight-Price-Prediction

*Project Overview*
The Flight Price Prediction project aims to predict the prices of flights based on various factors such as the airline, date of journey, source, destination, and duration. This project leverages data analysis and machine learning techniques to build a model that can accurately forecast flight prices, helping travelers make informed decisions and potentially save money.

*Feature Engineering*
Feature engineering involves creating new features or modifying existing ones to improve model performance. Key steps include:

Extracting day, month, and year from the date of journey
Calculating the total travel time in minutes
Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding
